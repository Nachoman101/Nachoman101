                        Hi! I am Javier Ordonez! I am a recent Graduate from George Mason University!
                        I graduated with a Degree in Computer Engineering! I like to go for outdoor
                        walks with my pet Korra as seen in the picture to your left and I like to 
                        hang out with people I love whether it be on video games or social events!
                        I face a little bit of an uphill struggle with job searching due to my 
                        residency status in the US. I currently only have my Permanent Residence and 
                        am patiently waiting for the opportunity to get my US Citizenship in 2024!
                        In the meantime, I am learning new languages (like HTML/C++/Javascript/SQL) 
                        and making projects to broaden my horizon of knowledge and strengthen my resume.
                        For the meantime, I put a hold on my job pursuit to place emphasis on these things
                        to allow myself to have a better chance at obtaining remote and out of state jobs
                        that will allow me to work without US Citizenship. Feel free to look around this
                        page to see the things I have done over the years! I felt like code being 
                        accessible through GitHub is better for now given that I am still fairly new 
                        to online security and would give the reader a better state of mind to view code 
                        via a trusted website.

                            This project showcases good execution of Object-Oriented 
                            Programming (OOP) and showcases good use of data structures 
                            in an efficient Big O scaling. The purpose of this 
                            project is to allow for the program to first gain input on the 
                            command line arguments given. If one word is given, it will 
                            find words from a BST in a Hashmap spot that sound similar to 
                            that word. If more than two words are given, it will determine 
                            if these words sound alike based on the BST entries. If the 
                            word isn't found in any of the BSTs in both cases, the program
                            will notify us of this occurrence and make a special print 
                            statement. Now, how does the program know which words sound 
                            alike? First, it will  read a file consisting of words and how 
                            they sound. The manner they sound depends on the very last key 
                            pronunciations followed by the letters that may trickle after. 
                            We use these combination of things to form a Hash Map key, and 
                            dependent on the availability of the spot in the Hashmap, we would 
                            either store this sound into an already existing BST at that 
                            Hashmap value or create a new BST if that spot of the Hashmap is
                            vacant. On the right, you will see what happens when only one word 
                            is inputted, more than two words are inputted (no similar sounding
                            sounds) and when more than two words are inputted (similar sounding 
                            sounds along with an entry that doesn't exist anywhere).

                            These project showcases thread efficiency via thread numbers and performance
                            optimization. We allow this by minimizing the amount of thread blocks there
                            are working on the image in total. This cuts into the amount of threads we use
                            and thus allows for higher operation of the Streaming Multiprocessor. By cutting
                            into the amount of threads we use we are essentially creating more optimal code 
                            by minimizing the amount of threads doing the same thing. These concepts are important
                            to the project that asks us to place a red bird onto any given image (while watching
                            for extreme cases) and filtering out the image leaving only but a white canvas
                            and the red bird. Check the images to the right for visuals on how this project

                            This project showcases the effect of a naive approach (Kernel 1) to an image distortion of 
                            making an image center dark and increasing the brightness as you head further away
                            from the center. Improvised solutions occurred in Kernels 2 and 3 where Kernel
                            2 swaps out a computed division multiple within the kernel with a computed division
                            kernel outside the kernel that is passed to the kernel. Kernel 3 expedites the performing
                            speed of the program by taking advantage of how many data bits you can grab at one time 
                            by manipulating the type of data you are extracting from the image. Say you extract data
                            of type char you only get 3 pixels in one global memory access. But if you extract data from 
                            type int you can get 12 pixels for the same time price of a char global memory access! The
                            images to the right show how the final image looks like and how the expedited speeds appear
                            for all the different kernels!
