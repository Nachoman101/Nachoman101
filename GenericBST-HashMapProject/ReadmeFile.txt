This project showcases some of my skills in creating Data Structures in Java. Feel free to look!
Objective: Use a Hashmap to store Generic Binary Search Trees with each tree housing words that sound similar to them. The words that have similar endings will be placed under one Binary Search Tree at one spot of the Hashmap.
